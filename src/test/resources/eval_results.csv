Answer: Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns from labeled training data, making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. [source: CLASS-1-1, CLASS-3-1, CLASS-4-1, CLASS-5-1]
Sources: Class C1-C1-T1 #1, #3, #4, #5."
S002,SEMANTIC,false,false,true,false,109698,"
Answer: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process information. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks with multiple hidden layers, enabling the model to learn complex patterns from data [source: CLASS-13-1, CLASS-14-1, CLASS-15-1, CLASS-12-1].

Answer: Java I/O (Input/Output) and NIO (New Input/Output) are Java technologies for reading from and writing to various types of input/output streams. NIO is an advanced version of I/O that offers better performance and more flexibility through buffer-based, asynchronous, and non-blocking I/O operations [source: CLASS-41-1, CLASS-42-1, CLASS-43-1, CLASS-45-1].
