Answer: Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns from labeled data [source: Class C1-C1-T1 #1, #3, #4, #5]. In other words, the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs and learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples [source: Class C1-C1-T1 #1].

Sources: Class C1-C1-T1 #1, #3, #4, #5."
S002,SEMANTIC,false,true,true,false,107287,"
Answer: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes or 'neurons' [source: CLASS-13-1, CLASS-15-1, CLASS-14-1, CLASS-12-1]. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks that can learn from large amounts of data and automatically improve their performance [source: CLASS-13-1].

S003,SEMANTIC,false,false,true,false,132129,"
Answer: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from unlabeled data, i.e., data without known outputs [source: Class C1-C1-T2 #1, Class C1-C1-T2 #2, Class C1-C1-T2 #3, Class C1-C1-T2 #5]. The goal is to identify hidden patterns or structures in the data [source: Class C1-C1-T2 #1].

S005,SEMANTIC,false,false,true,false,107885,"
Answer: Collections are data structures used to store and manipulate a group of related objects. Generics is a feature in Java that allows creating classes, interfaces, and methods with placeholders for types, enabling type safety and reusability [source: CLASS-32-1, CLASS-35-1].

Answer: Java I/O refers to the way Java programs read and write data to various devices such as files, keyboards, and mice. NIO (New Input/Output) is a Java API that provides an alternative to the traditional I/O methods, offering features like buffering, asynchronous processing, and socket-based network communication [source: CLASS-41-1, CLASS-42-1, CLASS-43-1, CLASS-45-1].
